## Description
Maria is a clean, simple, and fully responsive WordPress theme for corporate websites. 
It adjusts automatically to any screen size including tablets and smartphones as well as Retina displays. Theme is built using [Zurb Foundation](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites), a  framework for HTML5 / CSS3 which is SEO friendly. This WordPress theme was built with non-profit organizations in mind but be creative and unleash its full potential in eCommerce, business and other projects. Bastille is available in English, French, and Spanish for now.

## Adapting existing content
If you already have menus and widgets on the website, you need to do this after finishing the theme activation process:

1. Go to **Appearance > Menus** and update theme locations
2. Go to **Appearance > Widgets** and add old widgets to new sidebars

If you already have uploaded images on the website, you should regenerate thumbnails. To do that you can install [Regenerate Thumbnails](http://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/) plugin.

If you didn't use featured images you can install the [Easy Add Thumbnail](http://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-add-thumbnail/) plugin to dinamically set featured images for old published posts.


## Customization

This theme has loads of customization options available. To open WordPress Customizer go to **Appearance > Customize**. There you will find the following sections:
#### Header
Change the header image. It might support a random image list.

#### Colors
 Maria comes with six flavors: blue, green, red, orange, yellow, and navy. You might switch between these colors using the Customizer.
